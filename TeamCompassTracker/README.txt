This plugin sets player teams starting with 1 hunter and any number of runners.
Hunters are given compasses and when right-clicked, the compass points to the nearest
runner. When a runner is killed, they become a hunter. The goal is for the runners to
beat the game before the hunters kill them all. 

This plugin was written in Java using the Spigot API.
