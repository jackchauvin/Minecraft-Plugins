# Minecraft-Plugins

A collection of Minecraft Plugins written in Java using the Spigot API

This was done as a personal project. I kept getting these Minecraft videos recommended to me on Youtube, so I decided to watch one day.  It was on a weird Minecraft mod that changed the game in a really cool way!  I hadn't played the game in a very long time, but I decided to try to recreate the plugin on my own.  Since then, I have learned a lot more about Java and Spigot and have started to make fun plugins of my own to try out!
